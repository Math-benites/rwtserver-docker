# Rimworld Together Server - Docker
Very much WiP Rimworld Together Server Docker suite

## Description
Dockerised instance of the Nova-Atomic's Rimworld Together mod server.
Auto set-up, uses the latest version and update script.

## Installation

WiP
### Docker run

### Docker compose

## with Treafik
- The docker-compose file in the repo is designed around a Traefik reverse-proxy Self-Host solution to allow domain resolution and expandability without having to open new ports.
    

## Usage
Terminal access to the server : docker attach rwtserver


## Roadmap
- Finish core functions (cleanup and catch when server exit for function access)
- Add DLC choice options during set-up
- Add function to install mods?
- Use alpine linux for slimmer image? gcompat is required but throws error when interacting with dotnet.
- More on par with docker standards?
